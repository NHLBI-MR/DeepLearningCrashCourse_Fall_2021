# Deep Leanring Crash Course
### Fall 2021

## Overview

Deep learning (DL) is currently the most effective method to model the non-structured data, such as images, videos and time series signals. While there are many excellent online resources to teach deep learning with different levels of complexity, it is still of interests to develop and offer a deep learning crash couse for NHLBI DIR community. The motivation behind this course includes:

  1. Introduce the basics of deep learning for convolution neural network, recurent neural network and generative model.
  2. Introduce practical techniques for model training and debugging
  3. Help everyone code up CNN, RNN and GAN models as course assignments
  4. Help cultivate the interests inside DIR and improve community awareness of how to apply DL to different fields
  5. Encouraging social experiences by bringing together people who are willing to learn something new !
